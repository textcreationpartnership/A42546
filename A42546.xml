            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Gods providence is a Sun that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrateth every where, and is alwayes in his high noon, the motions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of though they ſeem oblique, go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes strait, and will (ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) bring the people of God to their deſired Haven, taking them by the hand, and leading them in all their pilgrimages, and both frequently and inſenſibly diverting them from the abyſſes, into which the pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their enemies would have often hurried them, who ſhall at last be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to confeſs, that innocence and
<pb facs="tcp:97413:5"/> truth are ſo dear to God, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall offend them, ſhall find Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven arming it ſelf in their defence, and that the Almighty God hath invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bands, which the ſtouteſt oppoſers of his providence cannot break, and that divine vengeance which is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, will (firſt or laſt) inflict on them the puniſhments they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it may appear that God in his government of the world, hath reſpect to the pooreſt Chriſtian, and meaneſt Artizan, (who no leſſe enjoyeth this munificence of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Creator) than the higheſt Prince or greateſt Potentate in the world.</p>
            <p>Thrice happy are they that live under the favour of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; every footſtep thereof is a ſpeaking to them in particular, that God will never leave them nor forſake them. Great peace may the ſoul have, when God is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and firſt mover of all his actions: what comfort may he take, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb facs="tcp:97413:5"/> that he walketh in the way his uncreated wiſdome hath marked out for him with his own hand? this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration well digeſted, is ſufficient (when things at any time ſeem to go croſs to our deſires, and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences ſeem alſo to contradict his promiſes) to baniſh from us thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets and diſcontents, which extort from us that acquieſcence and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which we ought at all times to have in God, and to make us to reſign our hopes, our joyes, our deſires, our deſigns and interests into the boſome of his providence. How indulgent is God to his children? He ſpreadeth abroad his wings like the Eagle,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.11, 12</note> ſtretcheth them out to cover each of his young ones, who are kept as it were in a neſt: none are ſo ſafely kept as Gods ltttle ones, who have a <hi>neſt under them, and a God over them.</hi> All Gods benefits are for their good, every feather in his wings helpeth to cover them, his wings reach to the ends of the earth; be a Chriſtian then
<pb facs="tcp:97413:6"/> where he will, God hath a wing of grace or a feather of mercy to reach him: and therefore when at any time we feel the touches of that wiſe hand that manageth our greateſt affairs; this may comfort us, that he will lay no more upon us, than he will give us a way out of, ſeeing he layeth them on us not as an angry Judge, but as a loving Father;<note place="margin">Tam pius ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo; tam pater nemo. <hi>Tertul.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>none ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate as he, none ſo much a Father as he,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> When it raineth, we cannot ſee the end why God ſendeth it through the thick Cloud, but when the ſtorm ceaſeth, we perceive preſently that it hath been profitable, and done good to the earth: ſo while Gods hand is upon us, we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee not the benefit of it, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we feel it to our comfort, <hi>Pſal. 119.71.</hi> The Saints are beautifull in the fire of afflictions: <hi>In the dark night of afflictions many glorious lights appear, which lye hidden in the Sun-ſhine of proſperity,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lactantius.</hi>

It is great wickedneſs and extream folly, with <hi>Job</hi>'s wife to think we ſhould bleſs God in proſperity, and blaſpheme him in adverſity; this were intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ingratitude in the higheſt degree, and with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to worſhip the riſing Sun in the morning for a God, and to curſe him at night (being ready to go down) for a Devil, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the benefit they had of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preſence, and not conſidering the benefit they ſhould reap at his next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. Juſt ſo do many men, they neither look backwards to Gods by-paſt
<pb facs="tcp:97413:7"/> benefits, nor yet forward to his future favours, but like Beaſts look only downwards upon their preſent eſtate, never praiſing God for the benefits they have received, nor praying to him for ſuch as they want, and yet may receive.</p>
            <p>Afflictions be the beaten path and road that lead to Heaven, trodden and trackt by all the holy Patriarcks and Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs, that have gone before us, and that must bet rodden by all the Saints and profeſſors that muſt come after us; therefore we must not look for a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar eſtate above all our brethren, but ſeeing it is the lot and portion of all Gods children, we muſt prepare our ſelves to bear our parts with patience. That gold muſt be much beaten and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and tried in the fire, that muſt bear the image of the King: the Church is Gods image, which being decayed by <hi>Adam,</hi> is to be renewed by our conformity to Chriſt. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt our Head was

            <p>And now Right Honourable, I here humbly preſent unto you this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Providence, who have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the various operations of divine providence, and have ſeen the flux and reflux of a thouſand accidents in theſe our dayes: and certainly! God cannot conceal his thoughts, deſigns, and loving kindneſs, from thoſe that obſerve his doings, who admire his ſage providences, and the miraculous conduct of his deſigns. The best im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all occurrences, is to conſider all things ſpiritually, turning them to ſpirituall ends and uſes: the living Chriſtian layes things to his heart; his ſearching ſpirit (like the Chymick pots) can refine all that is caſt into it; knowing that all things whatſoever; all accidents and events fall directly, and as it were perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly under the counſell of Gods providence; to the guidance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:97413:8"/> I leave you, praying that the Lord who bleſſed the houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> for lodging the Ark of his Covenant, will bleſs you with all ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in heavenly things in Chriſt. Thus committing your Eſtates to the protection of the Higheſt; my labours to your favourable cenſures, and my ſelf to your commands, I am</p>

               <p n="2">2.

But moſt remarkeable is that Providence of God, in diſpoſing of all things according to the prayer of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> bringing forth and ſhewing him the Damſell that was to be a Wife to his Maſters Son, by the ſame token which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deſired; which was this, that if the Damſell that he deſired to draw a pitcher of water for him, ſhould anſwer, ſaying, I will, and I will give thy Camels drink alſo, then that ſhould be ſhe whom God had appointed for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Wife, and ſo it came to paſs. <hi>Gods wiſe dispoſition is ſuch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cauſin,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The third head of Providence is Government: he governeth all things according to the counſell of his own will. God is not confined by any externall Law, nor ſtraitned by the courſe of nature; he acteth with great freedome and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now I argue thus: if the world and all things therein be not governed by God, either it is not governed at all, or it is governed by ſome other, or elſe it governeth it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

                  <note place="margin">When all things are created of nothing, and many things are compounded of contraries, and by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enmity ſeek the ruine of one another, none but God can preſerve them, for who elſe is able to govern ſo great a Maſs but an infinite power? <hi>Stock.</hi> on <hi>Mal. 3.</hi>

               </p>

It cannot be governed by any other but by God himſelf: for if there were another to govern the world, he muſt be either ſuperiour or inferiour to God; if ſuperiour, then God were not God, but he is called a great God, and a great King above all Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.3.

               <p>Gods generall Providence order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſpoſeth all the Creatures of the world, to thoſe purpoſes that he in his wiſdome hath appointed them; whereof we have a plain and evident teſtimony, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.2, 3. where notwithſtanding God would deſtroy the world by a floud of waters, to purge it of thoſe ſinfull and impure Inhabitants, yet he appointed the

Thus God is ſaid to be the Saviour of all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he preſerveth all men from temporall deſtruction, whereinto they would ſuddenly fall, were they not protected by his Providence. And ſo he is ſaid to preſerve both man and beaſt, that is, by his daily Providence he preſerveth them in life and being, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Thou haſt made Heaven and earth, and all things that are therein, the Seas and all that are in them, and thou preſerveſt them all,</hi> Nehem. 9.6.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Gods particular Providence; of the extent of it to the Heavens; to the Sun and Moon.</head>
               <p>IN the next place I ſhall treat of Gods particular Providence, which ſheweth it ſelf in particular things, and towards particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Lord in the Creation of the world acted like a King, giving Laws to all his Creatures: that which we call <hi>the nature of the Creatures,</hi> was Gods Law that he gave unto them; this nature was the rule whereby he appointed them to act and work. And as he made variety of Creatures, ſo he gave them divers Laws; their different natures are the ſeverall Laws whereby God ruleth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth them. The reaſon why the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97413:40"/> Trees and Plants ſpring from ſuch a ſmall Kernell or ſeed, and ſome of them bring forth one kind of fruit, ſome another; the cauſe why the Fowls, Fiſhes and Beaſts, have their ſeverall Elements wherein they live, and ſport themſelves, and bring forth their young, and provide for them, being ignorant of what they do; the reaſon is, becauſe God hath given theſe Creatures ſuch a Law, by which they act and move, which is a notable manifeſtation of Gods Providence. They are in a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that ſay this Providence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto univerſall things only, and not to particulars; for if they will have God to be ignorant of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things, as ſome atheiſtically have profeſſed then verily God could not underſtand himſelf, neither ſhould he be infinite in knowledge, (as I have ſhewed him to be before) if his Providence were not extended to every thing. Now if God have a certain knowledge of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing, why can he not then alſo take the care of them? eſpecially ſince particulars, (as they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97413:40"/> are appointed for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain end,<note place="margin">Explan. verae Relig. l. 1. §. 10.</note> as well in ſpeciall as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: and the very entities or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eſſences of things which are preſerved by God, the ſame cannot ſubſiſt but in their ſingulars, as one obſerveth; ſo that if theſe ſingulars (being left by divine providence) do come to ruine, then likewiſe may theſe generall eſſences alſo.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the extent of this particular Providence to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to the Sea, the Earth, and all Creatures that are therein. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Heavens. We read not only of a Covenant made with day and night, (a Covenant as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King and Subject) but alſo of the Ordinances of Heaven and earth which he hath appointed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.25. On the ſecond day of the Creation, God raiſed up the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like a Circle of Braſs, or rather like a Globe of Gold and Azure, which ſerved to divide the ſeven Orbs of the Empyreall Heaven;<note place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97413:41"/> temper the rayes and orders of the Stars, or that the courſe and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a moving body, would be more even and free in an Element ſo pure, and ſo pliable to all ſorts of motions, or for what other reaſon it were, the Learned have not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Now as we may have cauſe to admire the Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, in ſtretching out this huge ſpatious body of the Heavens, ſtretching out the Heavens like a Curtain, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. then may we alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly admire at the Providence of God, in that the Heavens ſhould be carried about, compaſſing the reſt of the world every day for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years together, and yet hold on in one tract, and keep one way, and never go out of it; this fully ſheweth the continuall Providence of God: the Lord carrieth about the Wheels of Heaven in a continuall motion, ſtill holding them to their diurnall task.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us look further to the Sun in the Heavens. The Sun ariſeth every morning; this great Eye of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97413:41"/> Heaven openeth his eye-lids every morning,<note place="margin">The Sun is the image of the Soveraign King, the heart of nature, it daily ſpeaketh to us out of the gates of the Eaſt, with as many tongues as it hath rayes. <hi>Cauſin.</hi>

The beams of the Sun are called wings, partly becauſe of its ſwift diſparckling of them, and partly, becauſe it ſpreads its light in its riſing like wings, whence <hi>Homer</hi> called the Sun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the golden-haired Sun; and the Scripture ſpeaks of the wings of the morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.9. <hi>If I take the wings of the morning,</hi> &amp;c. and of the morning ſpread upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. The benefits that we enjoy by the Sun are very many, and principally theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Light: how comfortable is it to ſee the light, and to walk by it. <hi>Truly the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun,</hi> Eccl. 11 7. Thus he may be called the Torch, Candle, or univerſall eye of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Heat: the beams thereof have a wonderfull and univerſall efficacy;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97413:42"/> there is nothing hid from the heat thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.6. Theſe beams are of a ſearching nature; great are the influences of the Sun; he ariſeth with healing in his wings. The beams of the Sun do warm, refreſh, quicken and cheriſh all things, dries up cold moiſtures that are noxious to the Creatures, excites and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Plants, Beaſts, and Men in the Spring-time, and reviveth all that ſeemed well nigh dead in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>FRom the Heavens I ſhall deſcend to the Sea, and therein Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is very remarkable: The Sea is a gathering together of many waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.10. it is the common receptacle of flouds and Rivers; and as the Liver in the body by the veins ſendeth bloud to the whole parts of the body, ſo doth the Sea ſend water to all the parts of the earth. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That all waters come from the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97413:59"/> ſea,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.7. <hi>He compaſſeth the whole earth as with a girdle, and bedeweth the world with his pleaſing ſtreams.</hi> In the depth of the earth there be many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities which breed winds,<note place="margin">

When mention is made of the floud that once drowned the whole earth except eight perſons, it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. that all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows or floudgates of Heaven were opened, ſo as the waters were not reſtrained but let looſe: by that dreadfull judgement of the deluge, God ſhewed us (as in a mirrour)

               <p>The fruitfulneſs of the Fiſhes in the Sea proceedeth from Gods ſpeciall bleſſing; for when the waters brought forth the Fiſhes abundantly after their kind, <hi>God bleſſed them, ſaying, be fruitfull and multiply, and fill the waters in the Seas,</hi> Gen. 1.21, 22. for being in a moiſt element, they do

Some kind of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es bring forth twice in a year, ſome three times, ſome ſix times in a year, and that in great abundance: the moſt wiſe Creator would have them thus fruitfull, partly by reaſon of the vaſtneſs of the Element which they muſt repleniſh, <hi>viz.</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is far greater, and more ſpacious than the earth, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides animals) is ſtuft with vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and partly, that there might be variety and plenty of them for man to feed upon <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

Beſides we read in holy Writ, that when <hi>Peter</hi> let down his Net into the Sea at Chriſts word, they incloſed a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Fiſhes, and their Net brake, but they loſt not the Fiſhes, but by the help of their fellows that were in the other Ships, they brought off ſo many Fiſhes to ſhoar, as were even
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97413:64"/> ready to ſink two Ships: and the phraſe of breaking in Scripture, ſometime ſignifieth abundance, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9, 10. where <hi>Solomon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a bleſſing upon ſuch as ſhall beſtow their goods on pious uſes, ſaith thus, <hi>Honour God with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thy increaſe, ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy preſses ſhall burſt out with new wine;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt not need to fear to be brought to beggery, but it ſhall procure thee an abundant bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>And here the providence of God is further manifeſted, that at certain times certain kinds of Fiſhes do enter in or go out of the Sea; and that which is yet more wonderfull, new ſorts of Fiſhes are taken almoſt in every Moneth, eſpecially in places near the Sea-coſt; and herein Gods goodneſſe appeareth, that ſuch multitudes of Fiſhes of ſeveral kinds ſhould draw near to the Sea-ſhores,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. Hiſt. l. 9. c. 12.</note> and in many Moneths be taken for the uſe of man; and more admirable it is, that thoſe creatures that live and breed in the water, be not all covered and clad
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97413:64"/> alike: For as <hi>Pliny</hi> noteth; ſome have a skin over them, and the ſame hairy, as the Seals: others but a bare skin, as the Dolphins: ſome have a ſhell like a bark, as the Tortoiſes, and in others the ſhell is as hard as a flint, and ſuch be the Oyſters, Muſcles, Cockles, and Winckles: ſome be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with cruſts or hard pils, as the Locuſts: others have ſharp pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles: ſome be ſcaled, as the ordinary Fiſhes: others be rough-coated, as the Soals: ſome have a tender and ſoft skin, as the Lampreys: others none at all, as the Porcontrell. Of theſe we may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy workes, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all,</hi> Pſal. 104.24.</p>
               <p>Moreover! God's providence is remarkable in ſuſtaining and feeding ſuch multitudes of Fiſhes, as are in the vaſt Ocean: ſome feed upon earth, ſome on mud and ſlime: others feed on ſea-graſſe or ſea-weed: ſome will eat herbs and roots, and others will feed upon fleſh when they meet with it, and all of them are exceedingly refreſhed with ſoft rain and gentle

Oh how do they leap, ſport and play, and rejoyce at the ſweet rain; they can ſuck the ſweet water out of the ſalt Sea; Here then is the reaſon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>why it raineth upon the Sea, where is no want of water, and it raineth not upon the earth that thirſteth for it, even for the puniſhment of man's ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and wickedneſs.</hi>

               <p>And here one thing more may be obſerved as to Gods providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fiſhes of the Sea; in that the Fiſhes were ſpared in the deluge from deſtruction, as reſerved in their

               <p>Now here was a mighty work of God, and that the Earth remaineth ſtill ſtanding in the water and out of the water is a clear argument of God's Providence in governing the world: 'Twas a great work that God did in <hi>Noah</hi>'s dayes in drowning the Earth with a floud; yet may we not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be a greater work of God to cauſe the waters to retire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Earth?<note place="margin">Vain was the fancy of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to move the whole earth if he had a place beſides it to ſtand upon.</note> God doth a greater work every day in holding back the water from drowning the Earth, than he did once in drowning it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it is the natural courſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>Now if the ſtability of the Earth be an argument of God's Providence (for the pillars of the Earth are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the ſtrength and power of God upholding and preſerving it) then may we aſſure our ſelves of the ſtability and firm foundation of the Church, and all the true members thereof; <hi>The righteous are an everlaſting foundation; they ſhall ſtand faſt like Mount Sion, which cannot be removed,</hi> Pſal. 125.1.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the extent of Providence to the Beaſts of the earth; of a speciall Providence in providing for Lions, and other Beaſts of prey.</head>
               <p>I Now proceed to ſpeak of Gods Providence,<note place="margin">Iddio riguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do egli pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priamente ai buoi quando ci detre queſia legge? Imperoche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimenti la providentia di Dio abbraccia ancora ogni minima coſa come. 1 Tim. 4.13. Ital. Annot. in 1 Cor. 9.9.</note> extended to the Beaſts that live upon the earth. <hi>Ask now the Beaſts, and they ſhall teach thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> that is, they ſhall teach thee that there is a Providence; <hi>who knoweth not in all theſe that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? in whoſe hand is the ſoul of every living thing,</hi> Job 12.7, 10. For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be rendered, that Beaſts (as well as Fowls) know their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed times, and keep the ſame courſe and order every year, but becauſe God hath given them a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inſtinct, whereof all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in the world are not able to render a reaſon. Gods Providence is ſeen in providing food for the Beaſts; he is ſaid to take the care of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97413:74"/> Oxen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>He prepareth rain for the earth, he maketh graſs to grow upon the mountains, he giveth to the Beaſt his food,</hi> Pſal. 147.8, 9. <hi>Every Beaſt of the Forreſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is mine, and the Cattell upon a thouſand hills, I know all the Fowls of the mountains, and the wild beaſts of the field are mine;</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, they are with me; they are under my care and proviſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.9, 10. He ſendeth the ſprings into the vallyes, which run among the hills, they give drink to every Beaſt of the field, the wild Aſſes quench their thirſt; he cauſeth the graſs to grow for the Cattell, and herb for the ſervice of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth: the high hills are a refuge for the Goats, and the rocks for the Conies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.10, 11, 14, 18. <hi>O Lord thou preſerveſt man and beaſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 36.6. and here the ſingular Providence of God is to be obſerved, even in the Birds of the Wood, and the wild Beaſts. Now on the contrary, although in our Stalls, Stables and Folds, both we our ſelves, and our Children and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97413:74"/> Servants,<note place="margin">I no ſooner ſet my foot on the earth, but there I ſee the ſheep feeding, here the horſe and oxe plowing, there the ſheep giveth us her lambs, and her wool, here the cow giving her calf and her milk, here I ſee an hedge, and as much care to keep it ſtrong, as there was to plant the field with any of theſe, there I ſee <hi>Behemoth</hi> Beaſts, ſo called for her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elephant. <hi>Woodward.</hi> Childs patrim.</note> do take great care of our Horſes, Sheep, Kine, and other Creatures that we keep about us, yet with how much difficulty theſe Creatures are brought up, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: many Lambs are loſt, many Calves die, yea their Dams do die with diſeaſes, notwithſtanding all our wiſdome, care and diligence. But the Birds of the Wood, the Fiſhes in the Waters, and the wild Beaſts, are deſtitute of all this help and ſuccour; yet they multiply much better, are better propagated, are not afflicted with ſuch diſeaſes as thoſe Creatures are, which mans care and diligence is moſt exerciſed about, becauſe their generation, birth and growing up, dependeth wholly upon the care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
               <p>And here it is admirable to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how God maketh proviſion for Lions, Bears, Tigres, Elephants, and all other wild Beaſts, which are many in number, and of divers kinds, elſe they would ſoon deſtroy the Inhabitants of the Earth: the young Lions are ſaid to roar after
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97413:75"/> their prey, and ſeek their meat from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.21. the roaring of the Lions is their ſeeking and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; the noiſe that the Beaſts make in their neceſſity, is their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſire of help, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better expreſs: they know not God; they confuſedly utter their deſires unto him: their ſpirits (as one well noteth) are not materiall,<note place="margin">Struth. <hi>obſerv.

The Lord ſatisfieth theſe ravenous Creatures, notwithſtanding they have great need of nouriſhment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the world is preſerved in its ſtate. Though all the Beaſts of the Forreſt do creep forth in the night, and the young Lions roar after their prey, yet when the Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their Dens, and man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour untill the evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20, 21, 22, 23. The light of the Sun driveth away the wild Beaſts to their Dens, that men may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97413:75"/> to go about their buſineſs:<note place="margin">It is a great gain to us, that ſavage Beaſts are not ſubdued to us as other Beaſts are; what profit would it be if we could tame Lions and Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards? it were but to make us more proud and arrogant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath exempted theſe from our power; thoſe hath he made tame that are moſt profitable to us. <hi>Chryſoſt. in Pſalm. 8.</hi>
                  </note> for if God ſhould not ſhut up the wild Beaſts after that manner, and give men the Earth to labour and traffick in, we ſhould ſcarce have a corner to put our heads in, and if God did not feed the young Lions, who do often lack and ſuffer hunger, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. and ſometimes are three dayes together without meat, as Naturaliſts tell us, they would make havock of all men, and ſoon rid all from off the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>And here we may take notice, that the Lord in chooſing Earth-Creatures for ſacrifice under the Law, he chooſeth out not only ſuch as could moſt readily be acquired, but alſo ſuch as might moſt ſafely be handled: he might have required his people to have preſented Lions, Bears, Leopards, (as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw the <hi>Chaldeans, Medes, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> to be no better; and as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw the <hi>Romans</hi> to be all of them Beaſts joyntly, ſo by nature we are all no better conditioned,<note place="margin">

               <p>NOw it will be neceſſary that I ſpeak of the ſpecial Providence of God toward Men. There is not a man that either is conceived, or born, or liveth, or moveth, or ſtandeth, or falleth, or dieth, but by the will and appointment of God. It is from the Providence of God that the hairs of our head are all numbred.

And here we may obſerve the great Providence of God in guiding the Wiſe men that came from the Eaſt to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Birth of Chriſt, in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the King; wherein we may conſider,

               <p n="3">3. Conſider we the place whither they came, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and divers reaſons may be rendered of their coming thither.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> and royal City; and therefore they might eaſily ſuppoſe that here they were moſt likely to hear news of this new King.

In a word, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Star directed them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thither they came.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perhaps they might have heard that here was the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Oracles of God kept, and here were the Colledges of the Scribes who were to expound and interpret them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It might pleaſe God to cauſe

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider we wherefore they came, it was to ſeek Chriſt, that they might worſhip him. They were (doubtleſſe) very much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when they found him not in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but Gods Providence much appeareth in bringing them thither.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By letting them underſtand by the anſwer of <hi>Herod</hi> from the Scribes out of the Prophet <hi>Michah,</hi> that they had not loſt their labour, but ſhould at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> find him whom they ſought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By ſhewing them the Starre again, which appeared not all the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97413:89"/> while they were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which leadeth them directly to the houſe where the Babe lay; and being come thither, they are preſently admitted into his preſence, do their duties and preſent their gifts unto him, as the manner of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to their Princes, and ſurely they offered him the beſt things and choiceſt commodities that their countrey afforded, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.11. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.2. This may be collected from the phraſe uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their treaſures, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. not profering to him, or preſenting him with what came next to hand, but with the moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities they could come by, or their Countreys would yeeld;<note place="margin">Si ſolum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum obtuliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, videri poſſent volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe matris paupertati ſubvenire; ſed quia addunt thus &amp; myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rham, aliquid certè ſubeſt myſterii. <hi>Bern.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. What moved them to come, or conducted them along, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſtrange Starre which they had ſeen in their own Countrey. But of this I have already ſpoken at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and therefore ſhall ſay no more touching it here. How long theſe <hi>Magi</hi> ſtayed with <hi>Mary,</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſilent; but it's very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that being come ſo farre, they would learn as much as they might about the Conception and Birth of the Babe; eſpecially being praead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by <hi>Herod</hi> ſo to do, and which ſurely they did accordingly, not doubting, but that the news would be very gratefull to him; but behold the providence of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the very night before this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they are admoniſhed to ſhape their courſe another way, becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> meant no good, but hurt to the Child, which dream of theirs might further admoniſh them, that this was to be ſome extraordinary Childe, as alſo by thus providing for him and them, that <hi>Herod</hi> might

                  <note place="margin">Omne bonum noſtrum vel vel Deus ipſe vel ab ipſo eſt.</note>3. I Shall in the third place ſhew, how the good Actions of Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Divine Providence; as we can do no good thing without Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo neither can any good thing be done without his Providence; All the good that we have is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or from God himſelf; there is no good thing but it is the gift of God, and cometh from the grace of God; in us, that is in our fleſh there dwelleth no good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Gods Providence about good actions appeareth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In giving to ſome men greater ability to do good than to others; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no man is born or liveth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but is bound to endeavour by all lawfull means to promote and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the common publick good of thoſe among whom he liveth. God in his wiſe Providence hath given to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97413:91"/> divers men divers gifts of the Spirit, all which are beſtowed to profit withall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. God hath alſo given great eſtates to others, that they might be liberal to thoſe that are in want.<note place="margin">Neceſſitatibus fratrum quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum poſſumus dare debemus, plus interdum quam poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> God will have the rich to be rich in good works, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. a thouſand Candles may be lighted by one; ſo a good man communicateth to all that have need of him; he had rather (like the poor widow) be in want himſelf, than in any thing be wanting in contribution to the Lords Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.2, 3, 4. he will communicate abundantly the things God hath lent him, as <hi>Obadiah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13. <hi>Doreas</hi> or <hi>Tabitha, Acts</hi> 9.36-39. <hi>Job</hi> 31.20. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Houſwife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.20. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth we ſhould do good according to our ability, ſo as we diſable not our ſelves of ever doing good more, as ſome that have ſpent all in a year, as though they did <hi>in diem vivere:</hi> but we muſt ſo begin as we may hold out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.20. A good man doth all the good that he can, and hindereth all the evil that he can within the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97413:92"/> compaſſe of his calling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In giving men not onely abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo hearts to do good: it's better to have an heart to do good than ſimply to have ability to do good.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Affectus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit nomen operi: danda beneficia nòn foeneranda.</hi> Lactant. It is credibly reported of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Sutton</hi> the founder of that eminent Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal commonly known by his name, that he often repaired into a private Garden, where he powred forth his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, and among other paſſages was frequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to pray thus: Lord, thou hast given me a large eſtate, give me alſo a heart to make a good uſe thereof. <hi>T.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us, <q>That wel-doing muſt proceed from wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing; for ſuch as thine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is, ſuch is thine Action:</q> 
                  <hi>Beneficentia</hi> and <hi>Benevolentia</hi> muſt goe together; we muſt do good freely, and not play the huckſters in doing good; the exerciſe hereof may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from the nature of love, which is not confined to it ſelf, but is reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto others, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. ſaying, <hi>Love ſeeketh not her own,</hi> that is, not onely or principally her own private, neglecting the common publick good. Many have neither hearts nor hands to do good, their tongues being as a ſharp raſor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it in others; What is this but to murmur againſt Gods Providence, when they have great cauſe to be thankfull to him for the good that is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97413:92"/> done, though by others? But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are imployed of God in any good work, let them know that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of publick good are Sacrifices of common hatred: It is a kind of Martyrdom to be hated and injuried for ſeeking to do good; but when we are aſſured that God's Providence hath imployed us, that we are in God's work, that we have his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or the aſſurance of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, we ſhall find theſe to be ſufficient to counterpoiſe the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and contradictions of evil men: It is beſt therefore to ſerve God chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in any thing wherein he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth us, and to do all the good we can, during the ſhort time of our abode in this earthly Tabernacle. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with all thy might,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In giving us opportunities of doing good. As God gives to ſome men riches, ſo he gives them objects to look upon. <hi>The rich and poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all,</hi> Prov. 22.2. God gives a man riches, and giveth him occaſions to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97413:93"/> make uſe of them, ſo ordering it in his Providence, that the poor ſhould meet the rich, that he ſhould have occaſion to uſe his riches: The Lord is the maker of both; He maketh one rich, another poor, that the poor man may be the object of the rich man's mercy; God hereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him occaſion to do it, and if they do it not, they ſinne againſt the bounty of God; becauſe God giveth them more than others; and they ſin againſt the Providence of God, in not taking occaſion to improve what the Lord giveth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say not thou to thy neighbour in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Come again to morrow, and I will give thee, when thou haſt it by thee,</hi> Prov. 3.28. <hi>Give to him that asketh, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.42.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97413:95"/> That God is the author of every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is an action, by giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinners even common aſſiſtance, without which the leaſt ſinne could never be committed.

               <p n="3">3. When God permits and ſuffers men to go on long in a courſe of ſin, and doth not reſtrain them; for if it pleaſed him, he could hinder men from doing evil. Now the will of God is two-fold,

               <p>The actions of men are either good or evil; God willeth good actions by his approving will. Evil actions may come under a double conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the entity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, ſo God decreeth them by his permitting will, for no ſinne could be without his permiſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18.</p>

                  </note> To explain this point by an inſtance or two: In the ſelling <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt, Joſephs</hi> brethren were agents, and God was an agent, and had an hand in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, but their ends were divers: they ſold him to be rid of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought their father loved him better than themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought ſo to falſifie his dreams, that he might not rule over them; but God's end was to provide ſuccour and ſhelter for their father and themſelves, and all their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Item,</hi> in the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions of <hi>Job,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was an agent, the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> agents, God an agent, and all theſe had their ſeveral ends: The Devils end was to have made <hi>Job</hi> forſake God, that ſo he might have fallen to his ſhare, the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> end were to impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh him, and enrich themſelves; and God's end was to prove the Devil a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97413:97"/> liar, and to manifeſt and declare the faith and patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and make him famous for the ſame to the whole world.</p>
               <p>In the divers and ſundry captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the <hi>Caldeans, Babylonians, Aſſyrians,</hi> and laſtly in their finall ruine by the <hi>Romans,</hi> their enemies had their ends, and God had his. The ends that the <hi>Caldeans, Aſſyrians, Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> aimed at, was their own pride and ambition, and the enlargement of their Territories and Dominions, but Gods end was the puniſhment of them to admoniſh others, and to fulfill the propheſies and predictions thereof. To be brief: in the death of Chriſt, the Devil had his end, <hi>Judas</hi> his end, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> their end, the <hi>Jews</hi> theirs, God his end: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils end was to make ſo many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and guilty of ſhedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud; <hi>Judas</hi> his end was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs to get thirty pieces of ſilver; the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> end was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and malice, becauſe they thought he eclipſed their glory; <hi>Pilates</hi> end
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97413:97"/> was partly to pleaſe the people, but principally not to diſpleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; the <hi>Jews</hi> end was hatred and malice, becauſe he reproved their ſins; but Gods end was to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Propheſies, and to bring to paſs the ſalvation of mankind, by that means which he had appointed. <hi>Shimei</hi> by curſing would ſhew his hatred of <hi>David,</hi> but God would make known the patience of <hi>David,</hi>

Manaſſeh</hi> was forced out of his houſe and Kingdom into a priſon; others by riotouſneſſe and unthriftineſſe caſt themſelves out of their habitations; ſome wilfully (like the Prodigal) leave their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. Some go into a ſtrange Countrey, and never return again to their own native Countrey. <hi>Shebna</hi> the treaſurer promiſed himſelf a ſetled habitation, and made himſelf a Sepulchre, yet the Lord threatens
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97413:101"/> to drive him out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.15. God commandeth the Prophet to ſay unto <hi>Shebna; What haſt thou here, and whom haſt thou here, that thou haſt hewed thee out a Sepulchre here, as he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus in a time of famine in the Land, <hi>Elimelech,</hi> his wife, and his two ſons went from <hi>Bethlehem-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> to ſojourn in the Land of <hi>Moab;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ruth 1.</note> all this came to paſſe by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that hath all things at his diſpoſing, that no man may think himſelf ſecurely ſetled; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould much humble men when they are driven out from their habitations, or their dwelling houſes are taken from them; and when they peaceably enjoy them, to ſtir them up to uſe them to the furtherance of God's glory, and day by day to praiſe God for the comfortable uſe we have
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97413:101"/> of them. If God call any of us to dwell in ſuch a place, where he hath given us great poſſeſſions, rich inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, fair houſes, pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchyards, ſtore of cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us ſay of them, theſe hath the moſt High divided to me: <hi>He divided to the Nations their inheritance, when he ſeparated the ſonnes of Adam, he ſet the beunds of the people according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the children of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 32.8. It becometh every one to do good in that place where the Providence of God hath caſt him. At the eſpouſals of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> the Elders and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> pray, <hi>that he might do worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Iſrael,</hi> Ruth 4.11, 12. <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> was the place of <hi>Boaz</hi> his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, here lay his Eſtate and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; there muſt every good man labour to do much good in the place where God hath ſeated him, either by courſe of inheritance, or by any other honeſt and lawfull means of poſſeſſion. It is noted of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, That he firſt executed his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry where he had been brought up, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. They are much too
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97413:102"/> blame that forſake their own houſes and get houſes in deſolate places where none can find them. God for this even threatneth, <hi>That many houſes great and fair ſhould be deſolate without an inhabitant,</hi> Iſa. 5.9. Men bring that judgement upon themſelves to runne away from the houſes which God hath called them to dwell in, leaving <hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> to lodge, Oſtriches and Satyrs to dwell there.</p>

                  <p>Theſe have their places it cannot be denied, but there's an hand that over-rules them, whereat we muſt look, and which we muſt confeſſe and acknowledge: Elſe ſhall we be like thoſe of whom God complaineth by his Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. This is as if one that were wounded ſhould fret and chafe at the ſpear, dart, ſword, bullet, or arrow that hit and hurt him, but never to regard the ſtriker, nor yet apply any medicine to the hurt-place; this muſt needs be extream folly. Thus did not <hi>David</hi> accuſe <hi>Shimei</hi> for railing upon him, but acknowledgeth the hand of God ſtirring him up, and ſetting him a work, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. and holy <hi>Job</hi> knew as much; therefore he doth not cry out upon the <hi>Sabeans</hi> for taking away his Oxen and Aſſes, nor blame the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> for carrying away his Camels; no, nor the Devil

                  <p>If the people of God conſult their own experiences, they will ſee Gods Providence admirable to them in this regard: If they conſider the means of grace to them, or them to the means, publick or private, how God brought them to live in ſuch a place, planted them under ſuch a Miniſter;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97413:120"/> how the Lord hath come in upon upon their ſpirits in the uſe of means, how God brought to their minds ſome notable paſſages of Scripture, which the Spirit of God ſet on with power upon their hearts; how God hath ordered ſome ſudden accidents befalling others, to work much good upon them.<note place="margin">

                  <p>IN reſpect of the firſt cauſe, all things come to paſſe by an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity, but in reſpect of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes ſome things come to paſs neceſſarily, others contingently: That is neceſſary that muſt be thus and thus, and cannot be otherwiſe than it is; that which is contingent, is that which before it is done, may be done, or not be done, or at leaſt after this or that manner. Neceſſity is either from an internal principle, and the nature and form of the thing; as the Sunne neceſſarily ſhineth, the fire neceſſarily burneth, every living creature dieth and is diſſolved. A man is a reaſonable creature, and a man not regenerate ſinneth: For this he hath from Nature depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and corrupted—or elſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is from ſome external,<note place="margin">Neceſſitas eſt modus agendi ordinatus in rebus naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Verron.</hi> Phyſic. l. 1. c. 5.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, impulſive cauſe; as the Elect cannot periſh; but the cauſe is not in themſelves, but in Gods

So Chriſt was neceſſarily to die at the age he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by neceſſity of Nature, for he might have lived many years longer, but by neceſſity of God's Decree; yea and alſo that he ſhould die the death he did die. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time neceſſity ariſeth from both together; as that the Sunne ſhineth is from its own nature, and that the light maketh the day is alſo from the Decree and appointment of God.</p>
                  <p>That the Reprobate ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ariſeth partly from the nature of ſinne that maketh them liable to death, and partly from the Decree of God appointing them to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Again, Cauſes are ſome definite, and appointed to ſet purpoſes, and ſome indefinite and free, and [both] in divers reſpects.

                  <q>IF there be a Providence, How cometh it then to paſſe that there is ſuch an ataxie and diſorder in the world? God ſeemeth not to regard the world, and the things thereof; all things ſhould be done orderly, thoſe that do well ſhould have well. On the contrary, there ſhould be no outward Idolatry, nor open Tyranny and oppreſſion, right ſhould prevail <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For of theſe things we ſee Kings have care in their Kingdomes, Noble-men in their Countries; and all maſters in their houſes. But the Devils are permitted to tempt men, and men permitted to ſin, yea ſome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſinning to deſtruction; The wicked proſper and often triumph over the good, evill men are often advanced, good men are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; as if a Prince would advance

Upon this ground it was that <hi>Cato</hi> a wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then denied the providence of God; and this argument hath not onely gravelled the Ethnicks, but even divers well diſpoſed.

               <p>
                  <hi>If God had a Providence, and did take care of the world, there would be no diſorder in the world: But there is great diſorder in the world:</hi> Ergo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur Dei providentia. <hi>For a wiſe man if he could, would not ſuffer any diſorder in his family: But God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in his Government when he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it.</hi>

Some, as one ſaith, would have God make the world all of gold, as that painter who unable to pencill the beautifull <hi>Helen</hi> with ſo great diverſity of parts, and conformity of members, filled his Table with Drapery which ſeemed rich, but was little to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">

                  <q>It is no marvell, ſaith <hi>Boetius,</hi> that men ſhould think that ſome things happen diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at all adventures, becauſe the reaſon thereof is unknown: but though men are ignorant of the cauſe after this or that manner, yet for that it is a good God that ruleth the world, we need not doubt but that all things are well ordered.</q> The judgment of God is not our judgment, neither are his waies ours, as the Prophet ſpeaketh; he doth it for the manifeſtation of his glory, by righteouſneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy together; and thus we ought all admire with the Prophet thoſe things we can give no reaſon for, ſaying, <hi>How great are thy works, O Lord, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all?</hi> All things which God hath made
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97413:143"/> are good in their own nature, and the evill things he permitteth make to his glory, and the good and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Elect, as appeareth in the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and in the paſſion of Chriſt.</p>

God threatned that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to remove her Candleſtick out of its place, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhe repented and did her firſt workes.</hi> This Candleſtick was the viſible Church in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> joyned together in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and enjoyment of Ordinances, as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick holding a Candle in it. When God formeth a people into a viſible Church, he ſets up the light of the Word among them, as men light a Candle, and put it into a Candleſtick; but when God will unchurch, he threatens to take away the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, take away all Church-priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Goſpel-ordinances.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, and humbly do conceive, that this Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> repented at this admonition of Chriſt, and was long preſerved, that it ſtood firm under the <hi>Romane</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and a long time after; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rage of all the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Tyrants, though that laſted three hundred years; for about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen years after, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:97413:159"/> about the year 413. after Chriſt, there was a famous Councel held in this Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to condemn the wicked Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and to aſſert the truth of Chriſt; which ſheweth, that it is not in the power of men or Devils to take away Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ordinances from any Church or people, till the Lord pleaſeth; and when at any time theſe are taken away, it is the Lord that doth it; it is he that removeth the Candleſtick out of his place.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:97413:159"/> Prov. 23.26. <hi>Solomon</hi> by means of his great wiſdom, did obſerve many things in his ſhort time of vanity, he ſaw a juſt man periſhing in, or by reaſon of his righteouſneſs; and that many a wicked man liveth to a great age and proſpereth, notwithſtanding his wickedneſs, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17. The ſhort life of man upon Earth yieldeth great variety of matter for much obſervation; the many ſtrange events that happen in a mans age, call for our moſt ſerious obſervation: As a City built upon a narrow plot of ground hath many Inhabitants in it imployed about ſeveral callings, wherein much may be ſeen within a little compaſſe: So the ſhort life of man yieldeth great variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be obſerved. <hi>When I applied my heart to know wiſdome, and ſee the buſineſs that is done upon the earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then I beheld all the works of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sunne; becauſe though a man labour to ſeek it out, yea further though a wiſe man think to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to find it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.16, 17. Though the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97413:160"/> ſecrets of divine Wiſdom in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes of his providence be often beyond the reach of the wiſeſt and moſt induſtrious Chriſtians; yet ought we not to let any of them paſſe without a ſerious obſervation. Do we not ſee that ſome men in a ſhort time will do great matters? What great things were done by <hi>Alexander</hi> by the two and thirtieth year of his age, Hiſtories teſtifie. And <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> being imployed by the <hi>Pretor</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to ride in Circuit, being <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,</hi> as Lord Juſtice, coming into <hi>Spain</hi> to keep the Aſſizes, eſpied there the Picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Acts; and when perceiving that he had conquered the world at his age, he deſired licenſe to depart ſpeedily, having diſpatcht his buſineſſe, and that night he dreamed a dream, which the <hi>Augurs</hi> interpreted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,<note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>de</hi> C.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97413:160"/> I ſaw it, and overcame it. Now if ſome men in a ſhort time can do great things, (as we alſo have ſeen in theſe our dayes) then God much more, who in wiſdom and power doth far exceed all the men of the world. Beſides, the Lord for his own glory doth vary much in the carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ge of things: As in the creation of the world, he not only made all things good, but made alſo great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of things, for the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Wiſdom, Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo in governing the world God makes uſe of variety of Agents in the world, led by divers principles: ſome by the ſpirit and power of grace, ſome by the fleſh, and by the ſpirit of the world, and by the Prince of the power of the air: ſome labour to build up the Church of God; others like <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> do hinder the building, and croſſe others who ſeek the welfare of <hi>Sion,</hi> and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeek for honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for themſelves. Now by theſe contrary effects of men, the Lord bringeth forth contrary events, and cauſeth his Glory to ſhine thorow all.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:97413:161"/>
               <p>How juſtly then are they to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that have lived long, yet make no ſpecial obſervations of thoſe events that have happened in their dayes? Some are ſo much taken up with vain and fooliſh delights, as pleaſant Muſick, jovial company, feaſting and carouſing, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the work of the Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider the operation of his hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Whoredome and wine, and new wine hath ſtollen away their hearts,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. Others there are whoſe hearts are wholly taken up with worldly buſineſs, only mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earthly things. It is an argument of a bruitiſh ſpirit to neglect obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>Wherefore is a price put into the hand of a fool, ſeeing he hath not an heart,</hi> Prov. 17.16. Gods work is about us, and in us (at leaſt in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence) and yet few there are that ſee it, or ſee God in it. It is the part of fools to paſſe by theſe things without obſervation: <hi>Who ſo is wiſe will obſerve theſe things:</hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:97413:161"/> underſtand the loving kindneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>It is admirable to conſider God's Providences without the Church among the Enemies thereof. The Kings of <hi>Aſsyria</hi> had overcome divers Nations; therefore <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſends meſſengers to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to tell him, <hi>That the gods of the Nations could not deliver them whom his fathers had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Gozar, Haran,</hi> &amp;c. therefore he would have <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he could have done the like to his God alſo. Now the uſe that he makes of it was, not ſlightly to paſſe by theſe things, but makes a contrary uſe of it, acknowledging his God to be the living God, and able to ſave him out of his hand; and that the gods whom the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> had caſt into the fire, were no gods, but the work of mens hands; therefore they had deſtroyed them. Now the iſſue was dreadfull to the <hi>Aſsyrians;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 37.11, 12, 18, 19, 36, 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>An Angel of the Lord in one night ſlayeth an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand in the camp of the Aſsyrians;</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> himſelf was afterwards ſlain by two of his own ſons, as he was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97413:162"/> worſhiping in the houſe of <hi>Niſroch</hi> his god. So likewiſe it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable concerning the Turks the vaſſals of that baſe and grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor <hi>Mahamet,</hi> who are great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Church; that the Lord hath ſo ordered it by his Providence, that they have not ſent ſuch huge armies againſt the Chriſtian Church for many yeares paſt as they did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
               <p>Within the Church Chriſt bids us diſcern the ſignes of the times,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.2.</note> and makes it a note of hypocriſie to be able to diſcerne the face of the skie and of the earth, and not to diſcern the ſignes of the times; (as he ſad to the Phariſees,) which then were admirable, the Scepter being then departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and one of <hi>Eſau's</hi> race enjoying it: <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt (the promiſed <hi>Elijah</hi> the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſt) being now come before the face of the Meſſiah as a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to prepare his way before him, Great Miracles wrought by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the blind receiving their ſight, the lame walking, the Lepers cleanſed, the deaf hearing, the dead
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97413:162"/> raiſed, and the poor having the Goſpel preached unto them; all which ſhewed him to be that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah that was to come, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Luther's</hi> time there was an admirable change;<note place="margin">What warrant have the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for their Jubilees, but the <hi>Popes</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Rome</hi>-Gates with his golden ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, promiſing pardon to whomſoever ſhall enter in at them that year, bringeth much Gold to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter's</hi> chair and the Pope's coffer; keeping their Kitchen ſmokeing.

               </p>
               <p>And is it not vrey needfull for us to obſerve the Signs of theſe our times; how many Nations profeſſing the truth of the Goſpell with us, have of late endured many hard and ſore trials, God hath deſtroyed the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97413:163"/> ſtrength of many Kingdomes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Charets and thoſe that rode in them; the Horſes and their riders have come down,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.21. 22.</note> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one by the Sword of his Brother. God hath even ſhaken the Heavens over us, and the earth under us, for the great formality and lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, intemperance, earthlymind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of the Nations, and for the great oppoſition of the Kingdom of Chriſt, the beauty of holyneſſe, and the truth of God clearly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, It is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how that many men in all ages have been taken away by ſuddain judgements, and that divers waies. <hi>Herod,</hi> on a ſuddain cometh upon the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and killeth them as they were Sacrificing, mingling their Blood with their Sacrifices, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1. upon eighteen others a Tower falls ſuddainly and killeth them, as the houſe upon <hi>Job</hi>'s Children. Thus ſome men have been taken away in their drunkenneſſe, and in their rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous meetings; ſome fall from ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, ſome be ſlain with timber, ſome
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97413:163"/> killed with the overthrow of earth, ſome drowned, ſome with falls from Horſes, ſome with Tiles or Stones falling from Houſes,<note place="margin">

Now the uſe and end of God's judgments upon ſome, is to work amendment and repentance upon all. Repentance (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> calls it) is the Phyſick of the ſoul, which all that be ſin ſick (as all <hi>Adam's</hi> brood be) muſt take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be recovered, and all that will not be drowned in the Sea of Sinne, muſt of neceſſity ſwim out upon the plank of repentance.</p>

We muſt not therefore ſay, we will have this or we will have that. Some will have faire weather, ſome foul, ſome will have plenty, others ſcarcity; and herein men are as often croſſed, as they are mightily deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being very unable to comprehend what is beſt for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holcot</hi> tells a ſtory of an Hermite, that having fowed pot-herbs in his garden, deſired fair weather and foul weather, as he judged to be beſt for his herbs and plants, and ſo had
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97413:167"/> all granted of God according to his requeſt; but not one herb ever came up, whereupon he thought there was a generall failing of ſuch herbs in all places, till on a time walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another Hermite, not far off, he ſaw with him a very excellent crop;<note place="margin">Putabas te ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiorem Deo, &amp; ipſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendit tibi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitatem tuam. <hi>Holcot</hi> in lib.

So there are ſome in theſe our daies that would have this government both in Church and State, ſome would have that, and others would have no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at all. Well were it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our daies would learn of this old Hermite, to be leſſe wiſe in their own conceits concerning ſuch things as theſe, and to relie more upon Gods Providence, than there would not be ſo much murmuring among us as there is.</p>

                     </note> it fell out that the day was ſo exceeding wet, that nothing could be done; whereat being enraged, he commanded all them that had bowes to ſhoot up their arrows at <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of him for that fowle wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which being done, their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes lighting ſhort of Heaven, fell down upon their own heads.</q> And juſt ſo it falls out with many in our daies, that murmure at God's Providence. He is a very bad Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that followeth his Generall with grudging; and he is a very bad man that controleth God in his works. Murmurers (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher obſerveth) are like unto ſuch as turn round about, till their heads and ſenſes being turned, they think all thing to turn round.</p>
               <p>Seeing then all things are ordered and diſpoſed by Gods Providence, we muſt not then ſay, we will do this or that of our own heads without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cave of any one, but do as <hi>David</hi> when he ſent the Ark from <hi>Kiriath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jearim:

It is the part of a good Shepherd to ſhear, and not to flea or skin his Sheep. <hi>David</hi> would not drink the water that the three Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies fet him, becauſe it was <hi>Pretium ſanguinis,</hi> the price of bloud. Such Magiſtrates may be ſaid to drink the bloud of their people, that live idly, and lewdly ſpend what they may ſpare.</p>
               <p>This gives a check to all ſorts of people that abuſe their places, that make more of them than the Laws of the Land, and a good conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and alloweth. All Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Takers, Cuſtomers and Searchers, that ſet their Commiſſions upon the tenters. All ſuch as buy Offices for gain; 'twere well if all ſuch were diſabled to uſe them.

In a word, all deceit in all dealing is wholly unlawfull; as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants working by halves, and taking wages for the whole; all falſe weights and meaſures, adulterate and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit wares, ſhewing of one ſort, and ſerving another; hoording up Commodities to make a dearth; Landlords alſo oppreſſing their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

               <p>Next to the Publicans, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers likewiſe demand of <hi>John</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, <hi>What ſhall we doe?</hi> Luk. 3.14. and he ſaid unto them, <hi>Do violence to no man, Accuſe no man falſly, and be content with your wages;</hi> There are three Branches of <hi>John</hi>'s anſwer to the Souldiers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Do violence to no man]</hi> Offer no injury to any man, abuſe not your power to do wrong, oppreſſe not thoſe whom you are appointed to defend, leſt they rather betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Enemies, than yield to the abuſes of ſuch falſe friends:<note place="margin">Hiſtor.

               <p>THis Doctrine of Providence may yield much comfort to all that are in Chriſt, and at peace with that God that governeth the world. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, let the multitude of Iſles be glad thereof,</hi> Pſal. 97.1. that is, Let the people that are diſperſed here and there in ſeveral parts of the world rejoyce that the Lord is upon his Throne reigning over the whole world. It is true, this is matter of terrour to his Enemies. <hi>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about,</hi> ver. 3. Yet is it matter of ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the people of God, that their Lord and King reigneth over the whole world. <hi>Sion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, becauſe of thy judgements, O
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:97413:187"/> Lord; for thou Lord art high above all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods,</hi> verſ. 8, 9. There are now many dark clouds round about the Throne of God, which ſeem to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the dim-ſighted carnaliſt from beholding the glorious actings of him that ſits upon the Throne. God's wayes and providences toward theſe Nations for divers years together have ſeemed dark and cloudy, and his actings to be in obſcurity; but when by an eye of faith the godly can ſee thorow all theſe clouds, they have wherewith to comfort their ſpirits in the midſt of all confuſions, namely, that the Lord reigneth.</p>
               <p>When we ſee a new face of things, and great mutations in the world; we are apt too much to look upon Inſtruments: Now ſuch a party is cry'd up, anon cry'd down: Some will inveigh againſt one party, ſome againſt another, according to mens ſeveral affections, principles, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, ingagements. It is true, Some ſin grievouſly that are the grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in great Revolutions and Changes, yet is it not in their power
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:97413:187"/> to change times and ſeaſons, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God alone to <hi>remove Kings, and ſet up Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 2.21.</note> as <hi>Daniel</hi> tells <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and as for men, <hi>Time and Chance happeneth to them all.</hi> God hath appointed changes unto men in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no wiſdom, riches or ſtrength can defend them from his appointment,<note place="margin">

Neither is it in the power of the moſt haughty Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to change the face of times and things according to their own wills; as we have ſeen of late by large experience in divers inſtances. No, this is the work of him who is a God unchangeable; and when he determineth to change times and ſeaſons, to root up ſuch and ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, or to change the form of any Government, he maketh uſe of Inſtruments of divers ſorts, good and bad, and theſe do ſtrive and ſtruggle one with another, and do all work together in accompliſhing his ſecret counſel, known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though to them altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; the temper of the times
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97413:188"/> carrieth upon it the impreſſions of Eternity, and the two great Wheels of the Worlds Charet [<hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Mutation</hi>] are driven by him <hi>with whom there is no variableneſſe nor ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning.</hi> And though the great Changes that have of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen this Nation, ſeem new to us, yet they are but God's counſels of old, and his Eternal Purpoſe brought into Act:<note place="margin">Acts 15.18.</note> 
                  <hi>For known unto God are all his workes from the beginning of the world.</hi> God's people then may comfort themſelves, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Government of the moſt High ſhall ſtand as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abide for ever,</hi> firm in the midſt of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions, Revolutions, and turnings of the time, and ſhall be upheld when all earthly Kingdoms ſhall be deſtroyed. And therefore as the Sunne alwayes keeps one tract and way in a ſteady courſe, becauſe his way is above the Air, where winds, and ſtorms, and tempeſts are: So the glorious Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is alwayes going on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtop to <hi>bring to paſſe his Act,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:97413:188"/> his ſtrange Act, and to doe his worke,</hi>
